While everyone is talking about how similar this song is to Come As You Are, we forget that ‚ÄúEighties‚Äù is great in its own right. It‚Äôs a song that harshly critiques the political and social landscape of the 80s, even if the lyrics seem vague the video makes the bands intentions clear. And it came out in the middle of the 80s!

This came out in 1985. It's incredible how they managed to pin down everything that will go on to become iconic about their decade

The one thing I LOVE about Killing Joke is their unique talent for taking a riff AND BEATING IT TO DEATH AND BEYOND OVER AND OVER VERY VERY SUCCESSFULLY.

THIS WAS THE LAST SONG THAT I HEARD IN THE 1980s.

That's true.

On 31 DEC 1989 at a few minutes before midnight, I played this song on my record player and timed it perfectly so the song would end at 11:59:59 PM.

It was the last time that I could say I was "living in the Eighties".

I first heard this song when I saw this video on MTV during Father's Day Weekend 1984.  I only saw the video once or twice that weekend and I never caught the album it was from.  Nonetheless, this song and video changed my life.

Later, I discovered one of my students was a fan of this band and he told me that this song was from the Night Time album, so I promptly went to the record store and bought it on LP.

If you were a teenager in the 80's and were into punk music and started a band with a group of friends  like many of us did... this riff was fun to play... regardless if you heard it in 82 when The Damned played it on Life goes On or in 85 by Killing Joke or 92 when Kurt used it for his song. I was born the same year as him and remember  thinking when I heard it... okay dude I'm digging the throwback vibe! I felt it was a nod to that music that inspired us  and him  no doubt..I think it  was obvious for people our age who remembered those days. For younger people...teens in 92 its likely it was lost on them and even more so now 30 years removed from Nirvana and 40 years from when the Damned played it...and even before when whoever played it before them! Lol

The most 80's rock song from the 80's.
